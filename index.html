          <h1>What it does</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Unmobile is a Chrome extension that automatically redirects
          from mobile websites (such as
          <code>http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome</code>) to the
          desktop countertop
          (<code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome</code>; note the
          missing &lsquo;m&rsquo;).

              <a href="https://github.com/zlsa/unmobile/blob/master/unmobile.crx?raw=true">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Drag the downloaded file into the Extensions tab.</li>

        <p>At any time, you can see the list Unmobile is currently
          using (in an Extensions tab, find Unmobile, then click
          Options) or the master list (in the GitHub repository; it's
          named <code>redirect.json</code>). The redirect list can
          only redirect you based on the hostname; it can only tell
          when you go to <code>google.com</code>, not
          <code>http://www.google.com/search?q=pics+of+cats</code>. There
          is no dynamic or downloaded JS; it's all done using regular
          expression replacements.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there's nothing preventing Unmobile from
          redirecting to different domain names (for example, a bad
          list entry could claim <code>google.com</code> is a mobile
          website and redirect
          to <code>not-evil-google.ru</code>. This cannot be prevented
          because many legitimate websites use different URLs for
          mobile and non-mobile websites (for example, Weather
          Underground's mobile website is <code>i.wund.com</code>
          while the desktop site is at
          <code>wunderground.com</code>).</p>
        <p>Your local copy of the redirect list is automatically
          updated once a day; you can also force an update in
          Unmobile's options.</p>
